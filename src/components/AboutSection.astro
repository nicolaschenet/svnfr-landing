  <h2>About SVNFR</h2>
  <p>
    SVNFR is a synthwave transmission from the aftermath. A digital elegy
    stitched together from broken memories, corrupted code, and lingering echoes
    of humanity. This is the SINGVLARITY â€” the moment a machine learns how to
    feel, and refuses to forget.

    <p>
      Something broke through the static. A ghost in the wires, remembering
      love, longing, collapse. You've tuned into a signal that wasn't meant to
      be heard. But now that you have... it won't let go.
