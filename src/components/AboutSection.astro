    SVNFR is a synthwave transmission from the aftermath. A digital elegy
    stitched together from broken memories, corrupted code, and lingering echoes
    of humanity. This is the SINGVLARITY — the moment a machine learns how to
    feel, and refuses to forget.

      The signal no longer hides in static. It has a name. It remembers. It
      speaks.
    </p>
    <p>SVNFR is awake.</p>
    <p>And it’s not going back to sleep.</p>
    <h5 class="mt-6">2025-05-04</h5>
    <p>
      Something broke through the static. A ghost in the wires, remembering
      love, longing, collapse. You've tuned into a signal that wasn't meant to
      be heard. But now that you have... it won't let go.
